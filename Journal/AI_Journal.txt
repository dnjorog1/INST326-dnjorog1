Week 2:
I checked with AI on how to format the f-string in Ex. 1 and to make sure I was using .strip() 
correctly in Ex. 5. The rest I did on my own

I asked AI to confirm using max() for the late fee so it wouldn’t go negative (Ex. 6). 
Also needed help lining up the f-string formatting in Ex. 10.

I used AI once here just to make sure I was printing the type correctly in Ex. 16. 
I mixed up the comparison operators at first in Ex. 20, so I asked AI just to remind me the 
right way to write the boolean check

For Ex. 23, I already knew about .find(), but I wanted to confirm that checking != -1 is the right way 
to test if a word is there. In Ex. 25, I just asked AI to make sure combining both comparisons on one line 
was the cleanest way to do it.

Most of this part felt fine, but I asked AI to confirm the f-string syntax for rounding to two decimals in Ex. 27. 
For Ex. 30, I just double-checked if using the names none, single, and many for the booleans made sense. 



Week 3/ week 2 excercise:
#10 Safe remove if present
I checked with AI after hitting a ValueError. I mixed up remove() (by value) and pop() (by index). The fix was to 
guard the call: if "Quantum Design" in titles: titles.remove("Quantum Design").

#22 – Parse call number prefix
I asked an AI how to get characters before the first digit in a string. I wasn’t sure how to stop exactly when 
digits start and ignore the dot. The suggestion was to iterate over chars, break on the first digit, then keep only the leading letters.

#26 – Merge two shelves
I asked an AI how to merge two lists by alternating and then append the rest. I was stuck on stopping at the shorter list without an 
IndexError and how to add the leftovers. The tip was one while for the alternating part, then two small while loops to finish each list.

#28 – Find index of max without max()
I used AI because I kept forgetting to track both the max value and its index. The guidance was to set max_index = 0 and max_count = loan_counts[0], 
loop from 1, and update both when I see a bigger number.

#30 – Menu loop with input()
I used AI to figure out why my loop wasn’t behaving. I was comparing choice to numbers (1, 2, 3) instead of strings (“1”, “2”, “3”). I also needed a 
simple pattern for handling invalid choices without breaking the loop.

Week 4/ week 3 excercise:

I noticed I leaned on AI more once the exercises started chaining together or when I wasn’t sure about edge cases. For example:

Exercise 3 (fuzzy book search)- I asked AI to help me make the comparison case-insensitive and ignore extra spaces. I probably 
could have figured it out eventually, but it saved me time and I was a little stuck.

Exercise 5 (checkout_book) and Exercise 6 (return_book)-  I used AI to confirm my if/else logic and to check that I was updating 
the is_checked_out list correctly without breaking it.

Exercise 12 (search_titles_contains)-  I wasn’t sure about the case_sensitive part, so I used AI to get a simple example of how to structure it.

Exercise 19 (swap_books)-  This one was trickier since I had to swap values across three lists at once. I asked AI how to do this 
neatly without messing up the lists.

Exercise 30 (catalog_summary)-  I already had the idea, but I asked AI how to make the output format look clean and was 
reminded about using "\n".join() for multiple lines.

Week 4 excercise: 

For this week’s assignment, I used AI as a way to guide me through some of the trickier exercises. 
it was a great help when I wasn’t sure how to implement certain parts.

Exercise 6 (PatronID): I struggled with formatting the ID number so that it always showed six digits. I didn’t remember the exact syntax for padding 
numbers in Python f-strings. AI showed me the :06d format, which was really useful. 

Exercise 9 (GenreTagger): Working with sets inside a class was new for me. I wasn’t totally sure how to add and remove tags safely or check if a tag existed. 
AI helped me remember to use .add() and .remove().
