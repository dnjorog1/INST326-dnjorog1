Week 2:
I checked with AI on how to format the f-string in Ex. 1 and to make sure I was using .strip() 
correctly in Ex. 5. The rest I did on my own

I asked AI to confirm using max() for the late fee so it wouldnâ€™t go negative (Ex. 6). 
Also needed help lining up the f-string formatting in Ex. 10.

I used AI once here just to make sure I was printing the type correctly in Ex. 16. 
I mixed up the comparison operators at first in Ex. 20, so I asked AI just to remind me the 
right way to write the boolean check

For Ex. 23, I already knew about .find(), but I wanted to confirm that checking != -1 is the right way 
to test if a word is there. In Ex. 25, I just asked AI to make sure combining both comparisons on one line 
was the cleanest way to do it.

Most of this part felt fine, but I asked AI to confirm the f-string syntax for rounding to two decimals in Ex. 27. 
For Ex. 30, I just double-checked if using the names none, single, and many for the booleans made sense.
