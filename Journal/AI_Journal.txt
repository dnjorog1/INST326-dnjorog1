Week 2:
I checked with AI on how to format the f-string in Ex. 1 and to make sure I was using .strip() 
correctly in Ex. 5. The rest I did on my own

I asked AI to confirm using max() for the late fee so it wouldn’t go negative (Ex. 6). 
Also needed help lining up the f-string formatting in Ex. 10.

I used AI once here just to make sure I was printing the type correctly in Ex. 16. 
I mixed up the comparison operators at first in Ex. 20, so I asked AI just to remind me the 
right way to write the boolean check

For Ex. 23, I already knew about .find(), but I wanted to confirm that checking != -1 is the right way 
to test if a word is there. In Ex. 25, I just asked AI to make sure combining both comparisons on one line 
was the cleanest way to do it.

Most of this part felt fine, but I asked AI to confirm the f-string syntax for rounding to two decimals in Ex. 27. 
For Ex. 30, I just double-checked if using the names none, single, and many for the booleans made sense. 



Week 3/ week 2 excercise:
#10 Safe remove if present
I checked with AI after hitting a ValueError. I mixed up remove() (by value) and pop() (by index). The fix was to 
guard the call: if "Quantum Design" in titles: titles.remove("Quantum Design").

#22 – Parse call number prefix
I asked an AI how to get characters before the first digit in a string. I wasn’t sure how to stop exactly when 
digits start and ignore the dot. The suggestion was to iterate over chars, break on the first digit, then keep only the leading letters.

#26 – Merge two shelves
I asked an AI how to merge two lists by alternating and then append the rest. I was stuck on stopping at the shorter list without an 
IndexError and how to add the leftovers. The tip was one while for the alternating part, then two small while loops to finish each list.

#28 (index of max via loop)
No exception, but common logic bug: updating the max value and forgetting to update the index, which prints the wrong name. Starting 
with max_index = 0 and updating both fixes it.
