Week 2:
I checked with AI on how to format the f-string in Ex. 1 and to make sure I was using .strip() 
correctly in Ex. 5. The rest I did on my own

I asked AI to confirm using max() for the late fee so it wouldnâ€™t go negative (Ex. 6). 
Also needed help lining up the f-string formatting in Ex. 10.
